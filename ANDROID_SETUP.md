# Android Setup Guide

Your project has been successfully configured for Android development using Capacitor!

## What Was Done

1. ✅ Updated `capacitor.config.ts` with proper app ID and name
2. ✅ Built the web application
3. ✅ Added Android platform using Capacitor CLI
4. ✅ Synced web assets to Android project

## Project Structure

The `android/` directory now contains a complete Android Studio project that wraps your React web app.

## Next Steps

### 1. Open in Android Studio

```bash
npx cap open android
```

This will launch Android Studio with your project.

### 2. Run on Emulator or Device

In Android Studio:
- Click the "Run" button (green play icon)
- Select an emulator or connected physical device
- The app will build and launch

### 3. Development Workflow

When you make changes to your web app:

```bash
# 1. Build your web app
npm run build

# 2. Sync changes to Android
npx cap sync android

# 3. (Optional) Open in Android Studio
npx cap open android
```

## Requirements

Make sure you have:
- ✅ Android Studio (latest version)
